## Concept

What does your app do, what is the goal? (passing butter)

## Installation

Idk, gewoon repo clonen?

```bash
npm install
```

```json
{
  "name": "my-package",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "scripts": {
    "iets": "iets"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "iets": "*"
  }
}
```

## Actor Diagram

Which actors are there in your application? (actor diagram)

## Assignment

In this course I learned to build a web application without frameworks or unnecessary libraries, but with vanilla HTML, CSS & JavaScript as much as possible. The end result is a modular, single page web app (SPA). Data will be retrieved from an external API of my choice, manipulated and finally shown in the UI of the App. I have learned different ways to structure code and developed my own coding style. With the gained knowledge I'm able to build interactive prototypes, based on real data. Also, I gained a better understanding of the how API's, frameworks and libraries work.

### Learning goals

- _You can add structure to your code by applying patterns. You can defend the choice for the chosen patterns_
- _You can retrieve data, manipulate it and dynamically convert it to html elements using templating_
- _You understand how you can work with an external API using asynchronous code_
- _You understand how you can manage state in your application and you inform the user of state where necessary_

### Week 1 - Hello API üêí

Goal: Retrieve data from an API and render it in an overview page.
--> hoe heb ik dit gedaan? --> verwijzing naar wiki, of inklappen?

### Week 2 - Design and Refactor üõ†

Goal: Design the web app. Add routes and states. Rendering detail page.

### Week 3 - Wrapping up üéÅ

Goal: Manipulate data. Split code into modules. Reflect on end result
